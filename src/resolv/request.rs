//! A DNS request.
//!
//! We call the cycle of sending a question to a single upstream DNS resolver
//! and hopefully receiving a response a *request* (as opposed to *query*
//! which is the process of asking as many known upstream resolvers as
//! necessary to get an answer).
//!
//! Requests also bridge the gap between the future of the query that can
//! run anywhere and the future of the service in question that runs inside
//! a reactor core. Because of that, there are two types herein, one for
//! each side of that gap and somewhat lamely named `QueryRequest` and
//! `ServiceRequest`.
//!
//! Since queries normally run a sequence of requests until the first one
//! succeeds, we should be able to reuse the request message in subsequent
//! requests. However, a service needs to be able to add its own OPT record
//! to the additional section for EDNS0 support, so we can’t really use the
//! same message for each service. Instead, we need to revert to the
//! end of the question section. While this is not yet supported by
//! `MessageBuilder`, the types herein already support this notion by
//! returning the request message as part of their responses. However, there
//! is a possibility that the message gets lost during transfer over the gap.
//! Since the query doesn’t store a copy, this case means that the query
//! fails fatally.
//!
//! Worse, since the `ServiceRequest` contains the message and the `Drop`
//! trait operates on a mutable reference, we can’t fail the request in its
//! `Drop` implementation and instead have to rely on services always either
//! succeeding or failing all their requests.

/// future resolving either into both the actual request result, either a
/// `MessageBuf` with a response or an `Error`, and the original request
/// message or an `io::Error` in which case the original message is lost.
///
/// The request has to send a service request to a service which can fail.
/// Because of that, it is internally a `Result`. When sending fails, it
/// contains an `Err` which is translated into a fatal error. If all is
/// well, it contains an `Ok` with the oneshot future that will receive the
/// result from the service request.
